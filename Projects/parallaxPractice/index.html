                Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing, which is constructed of a large number of interconnected baffled cells. The wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.Paragliding is usually launched by foot, by running down a gentle slope or being towed into the air by a vehicle, such as a car or boat. Once in the air, the pilot can maneuver the glider by shifting their body weight and using steering lines attached to the wing's trailing edge.

                Paragliders are able to stay aloft for extended periods of time by finding and riding thermals, currents of rising air created by the sun heating the ground.Paragliding can be done for recreation or competition, and there are various organizations and clubs around the world that offer training and certification for pilots. The sport has grown in popularity in recent years and can now be found in many countries around the world. It is considered as a safe sport but like any adventure sport, it has its own set of risks and precautions need to be taken.
